2D Spectroscopy
===============

In this example we show skultrafasts current capabilties when it comes to
working with 2D-spectra. First we need to get a sample spectrum. For that, we
use example data, which will be downloaded from figshare if necessary. The data
was measured with the quickcontrol-software from phasetech.

We start by import the required functionalty.

# Loading the data
# ----------------
#
# There are two `.info`-files the directory. The first contains the transient
# 1D-data and the second the 2d-data. Here in this tutorial we will work with
# the 2D data. Hence we select the second file and open it by instancing an
# `QC2DSpec`-class. Given the info-file, the class collects all necessary data.
# It is also responsible to turn the saved data, which are inferogramms, into
# 2D-spectra. This process can also include some preprocessing. Here we we apply
# 4 times upsampling of pump axis and use 10 pixel left and right to calculate
# and subtract a background. For apodization we are use the default hamming window.

# To create the dataset to work with form raw data we call the make_ds methods,
# which returns a dict of `TwoDim` objects to work with. The dict contains
# parallel (`para`), perpendicular (`perp`) and isotropic (`iso`) datasets. We
# select the isotropic dataset.

ds_all = qc_file.make_ds()
ds_iso = ds_all['iso']

# %%
# The `TwoDim`-objects are the core structure to work with. They contain both
# frequency-axis, `pump_freqs` and `probe_freqs`, the waiting times `t`, and the
# actual data `spec2d`.
#
# To start and to get an overview, we plot a contour-plot at 1 ps. Like for the
# `TimeResSpec`-class, plotting functions are accessible under the plot
# attribute.

# Selecting a subrange
# --------------------
#
# Most of the 2D-map is empty. We are only interested in the region of the
# signal, hence we have to select a sub-range. The methods return a new and
# smaller `TwoDim` dataset. In general, most methods which would modify
# the data return a new dataset. Now we also plot the contour at different
# time-points, 0.5, 1 and 7 ps.

# There is also a `.select_t_range` method.
#
# Extracting a transient 1D-spectrum
# ----------------------------------
#
# Using the projection theorem and integrating over the pump axis, we can
# get a normal transient 1D-dataset. This can be done by the
# `TwoDim.integrate_method`, which returns a skultrafast `TimeResSpec`. Here we
# integrate over the whole range. It is possible to integrate over a sub-range
# by supplying arguments to the function.

# Center line slope analysis
# --------------------------
#
# One of the most common ways to analyze a two-dimensional dataset is to
# extract the frequency-frequency correlation function (FFCF). The most common
# ways is to determine the center line slope, which under certain assumptions is
# proportional to the normalized FFCF.
#
# To extract the cls for a single time-point, we use the `single_cls`-method.
# Let's determine the cls for 1 ps. We use a window of 10 cm-1 in both pump and
# probe axis around the maximum for determination. The algorithm currently uses
# the center-of-mass.

# First plot the maxima
ax.plot(x_cls, y_cls, color='yellow', marker='o', markersize=3, lw=0)

# Plot the resulting fit. Since the slope is a function of the pump frequencies,
# we have to use y-values for the slope.
ax.plot(y_cls * lin_fit.slope + lin_fit.intercept, y_cls, color='w')

# %%
# To determine the full CLS-decay, we can use the `cls`-method. It takes the
# same arguments as `single_cls`, except the single waiting time. The
# information of each single cls is accessible in the cls result.

# Diagonal
# --------
#
# Another common usage of two-dimensional spectra is the extraction of the
# diagonal. The signal on diagonal is proportional to the fourth power of the
# transition dipole-moment, in contrast to the regular absorption
# (e.g. FTIR) spectrum, which is  proportional to the second power. Hence, shoulders
# of peaks are often more distinct in the diagonal. The diagonal can be extracted via the
# 'diag_and_antidag'-method. The methods returns an object containing both the
# diagonal and anti-diagonal, additional it contains the y-coordinates of the
# lines. Latter can be useful for plotting. Again the method takes a waiting time
# to select the spectrum for extraction. Additionally, it takes parameters to shift
# the position of the diagonal used for extraction. If not given, it goes through
# the position of the minimum.

# As an alternative, the pump-slice-amplitude method is also supported. Here we are calculating the
# difference between the maximum and minimum signal along the probe axis for each pump frequency.
# The resulting curve shares the same properties as the diagonal but is supposedly less influenced
# by excited state overlap (Valentine et al. doi:10.1021/acs.jpca.1c04558)
