WARNING! THE PROJECT IS A RESTRUCTERING PHASE AND NOT VERY USEABLE FOR NEW USERS!

What is skultrafast?
====================

Skultrafast stands for scikit.ultrafast and is an
python package which aims to include everthing
needed to analyze data from time-resovled spectroscopy experiments in
the femtosecond domain.

Aims of the project
-------------------
I would include any kind of algorithm or data structure which
comes up in ultrafast physics. Also, data exploration
should be made easy (a.k.a. has a gui for these parts).

Users
-----
At the moment it is mostly me and other people in my group. I would be happy
if anyone would like to join the project!


Software prerequisites
=======================
Python 3 only. Requiers numpy, scipy, lmfit, matplotlib, sklearn, statsmodels.

For maximal speed python opencl should be installed.
